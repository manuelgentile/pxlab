# The PXLab project #

PXLab is a collection of Java classes and applications for running psychological experiments. The PXLab system allows interactive design of a wide range of experiments from all areas of psychological research. It includes a run time control system which runs experiments under highly optimized timing constraints.

This project born from an idea of the [Prof. Hans Irtel] [1]. Hans Irtel was professor for psychology and he taught sensation and perception and experimental psychology at University of Mannheim (Germany). After his premature death, September 30, 2008, the project was stopped.

## The Project ##

The idea is now to update this project, thanks to improving the applications and adding new features. 

We invite you to visit the [official web site of the original project] [2], in which it is possible to find also the [manual] [3] and [some demos] [4].
Here you can find any news regarding this project and information on new features and applications developed.
