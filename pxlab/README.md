# The PXLab project #

PXLab is a collection of Java classes and applications for running psychological experiments. The PXLab system allows interactive design of a wide range of experiments from all areas of psychological research. It includes a run time control system which runs experiments under highly optimized timing constraints.

This project born from an idea of the [Prof. Hans Irtel] [1]. Hans Irtel was professor for psychology and he taught sensation and perception and experimental psychology at University of Mannheim (DE). After his premature death, September 30, 2008, the project was interrupted.
